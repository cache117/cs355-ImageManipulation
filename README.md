# ImageManipulation
This encompasses the previous features of the other labs, with addition features of image manipulation. It uses the same shell as the other labs.
##Features
* All features from previous labs
* Brightness adjustment
* Contrast adjustment
* Noise removal
  * blurring (uniform averaging)
  * (median filtering)
* Sharpening (unsharp masking)
* Edge detection (gradient magnitude)

The drawing of the image should be done *behind* anything drawn with the 2D drawing tools or 3D
rendering (if any). It forms a sort of backdrop that always stays behind the other drawings.
